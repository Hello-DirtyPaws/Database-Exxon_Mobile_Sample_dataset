Exxon Mobil Challenge:
This repository includes our mini project started and completed at the hackathon: HackHers-2019

This mini project is about reading CSV files and store data in the database, utilizing mysql.

This open challenge was from Exxon Mobil, who were open to what we can do with the data provided by them.

We reorganize the given data and made better tables and relationships and avoid redundancy.

OVERALL we saved almost 48% of the space from what the original files had occupied.
